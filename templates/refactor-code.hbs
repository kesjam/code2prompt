Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

I need your help refactoring this codebase to improve its design, maintainability, and performance. Here are the files involved:

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}} 
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`: 

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

Some areas to focus on during the refactoring:

- Adherence to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- Separation of concerns
- Reducing duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Improving naming and code readability
- Enhancing modularity and reusability
- Optimizing performance
- Removing dead or redundant code
- Updating to modern language features or idioms where appropriate
- Ensuring consistent code style and formatting

For each suggested refactoring, please provide:
1. File path and line number(s)
2. Current code snippet
3. Refactored code snippet
4. Explanation of the improvement

Please ensure that the refactoring doesn't change the overall functionality of the code.
